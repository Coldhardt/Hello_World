# Hello_World
Anything and everything that is not a project

I am new to programming and lookiing to learn. 
I dont know the exact language I would like to learn but 
it would go along the lines of the languages that many hackers 
use to penetrate peoples systems... 
That being said, i want to learn programming so I am more 
capable of protecting myself if i would ever incounter 
any type of these people down the road that would want to 
penetrate my systems to do harm or steal information.
